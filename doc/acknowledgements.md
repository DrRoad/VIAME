VIAME was originally developed with funding from the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)'s Fisheries Strategic
Initiative on Automated Image Analysis (AIASI) committee, in addition
to other groups within NOAA, such as the Marine Mammals Lab.

Additional thanks goes to the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL)
RY and RI divisions, with some features developed across SBIRS/STTRS
(e.g. PR# 88ABW-2019-4904) in addition to other government and commercial
partners who have funded different components and tookits which VIAME
uses.
