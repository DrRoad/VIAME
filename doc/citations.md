VIAME builds on top of a number of different algorithm and software,
frameworks, in some case using them as-is, in others having custom
implementations with a few modifications on top.


### Software Framework

System Backend - Dawkins, Matthew, Sherill, Linus, et al. "An open-source platform for
underwater image and video analytics." 2017 IEEE Winter Conference on
Applications of Computer Vision (WACV). IEEE, 2017.


### Algorithms

Cascade Faster R-CNN Implementation - Chen, Kai, et al. "MMDetection: Open
MMLab Detection Toolbox and Benchmark." arXiv preprint arXiv:1906.07155 (2019).

YOLOv3 Implementation - Redmon, Joseph, and Ali Farhadi. "Yolov3: An
incremental improvement." arXiv preprint arXiv:1804.02767 (2018).

Rapid Model Generation Implementation - No paper yet

Default Tracker - Sadeghian, Amir, et al. "Tracking the untrackable: Learning
to track multiple cues with long-term dependencies." Proceedings of the IEEE
International Conference on Computer Vision. 2017.
